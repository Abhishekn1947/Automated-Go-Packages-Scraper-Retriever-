# Automated-Go-Packages-Scraper-Retriever-

Please Check out the Project reports, Code and Ppt to get a better Understanding of the project I have worked on. 

The "Go Packages Details Retriever" project aims to provide a user-friendly tool that fetches and presents essential information about Go packages from the Go Package Index (https://pkg.go.dev/). The program allows users to specify the package names and retrieve details such as the latest version, documentation link, and license information. The retrieved information is organized and presented in an Excel file for easy access and reference. This project report will document the step-by-step development and description of each code snippet added to the program.
